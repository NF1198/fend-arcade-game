Game overview
=============

[Play Game](http://nf1198.github.io/fend-arcade-game/)

This is a game of skill daring. Use the arrow keys (L-R-U-D) to
navigate your character across the road to safety. Along your
way, you may find treasures to enhance your score. But, beware!
You may get run over by a giant lady bug.

Use the _spacebar_ to reset your game.

Building the game
=================

This game is based on the template provided by the Udacity fontend
developer nanodegree program. Game logic is implemented primarily in
app.js. The [Leshy sprite sheet tool](https://www.leshylabs.com/apps/sstool/) was used to build the sprite sheet.
